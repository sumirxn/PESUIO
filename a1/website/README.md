Question set and responses:

1. What is RAG

Answer: RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a method that combines information from a language model's internal knowledge with external knowledge retrieved from specific corpora or knowledge bases. This approach is designed to provide more reliable answers by leveraging both sources of information.

2. What is Astute RAG

Answer: Astute RAG is a novel RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach designed to be resilient to imperfect retrieval augmentation, while preserving RAG grounding effect when RAG is reliable. It effectively differentiates the reliability of the LLM's (Language Model's) intrinsic knowledge and the external information retrieved in RAG, utilizing each only when trustworthy and ensuring proper integration. Astute RAG initially elicits information from LLMs‚Äô internal knowledge to complement the passages retrieved from external sources. Then, it conducts source-aware knowledge consolidation of information from various internal and external sources, combining consistent information, identifying conflicting information, and filtering out irrelevant information. Finally, it proposes answers based on each group of consistent passages and compares the answers from different passage groups to determine the final answer. Astute RAG has demonstrated superior performance compared to previous RAG approaches and consistently outperforms baselines across different retrieval quality levels. It is effective in resolving knowledge conflicts between internal and external knowledge.

3. Explain imperfect retrieval.

Answer: Imperfect retrieval refers to a situation where the information or data retrieved may not be completely accurate, relevant, or sufficient for a specific purpose. This can be due to various factors such as limitations in the quality of the corpus, the reliability of the retrievers, and the complexity of the queries. As a result, this can lead to issues in the trustworthiness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models. This phenomenon is prevalent across different datasets, with a significant percentage of data not having any mentions of the correct answer within any retrieved passages. Imperfect retrieval can result in RAG failures, particularly when the retrieval precision is low. It is also associated with knowledge conflicts, where there are discrepancies between the internal knowledge of the language model and the retrieved passages from external sources. Effectively combining internal and external knowledge is crucial to overcome the limitations of relying solely on either source.

4. What is retrieval precision?

Answer: Retrieval precision refers to the proportion of retrieved items that are relevant to the user's information need. In other words, it measures the accuracy of the retrieval process in returning items that match the user's search criteria. A high retrieval precision indicates that the majority of retrieved items are relevant, while a low retrieval precision suggests that many of the retrieved items are not relevant. This metric is often used in information retrieval 
and search systems to evaluate the effectiveness of the retrieval process.

5. Give a mathematical formula for retrieval precision

Answer: Retrieval precision can be calculated as the number of relevant documents retrieved divided by the total number of documents retrieved. Mathematically, it can be represented as:

Retrieval Precision = Number of Relevant Documents Retrieved / Total Number of Documents Retrieved

6. What are knowledge conflicts?

Answer: Knowledge conflicts refer to situations where the answer generated by a large language model (LLM) differs depending on whether it uses its internal knowledge or information from retrieved passages from external sources. These conflicts can occur when either the LLM's internal knowledge or the external knowledge is correct, emphasizing the importance of effectively combining both sources to overcome the limitations of relying solely on one source. However, previous work has shown that LLMs might not always respond based on a comprehensive understanding of conflicting knowledge.

7. Give the framework of Astute Rag

Answer: Astute RAG is a framework designed to be resilient to imperfect retrieval augmentation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), while preserving the grounding effect of RAG when it is reliable. The framework consists of three main steps:

1. **Information Elicitation**: Astute RAG first elicits information from the Large Language Model's (LLM's) internal knowledge to explicitly complement the passages retrieved from external sources. This step helps in preserving the RAG grounding effect even when the retrieved information is not reliable.

2. **Source-Aware Knowledge Consolidation**: This step involves consolidating information from various internal and external sources in a source-aware manner. 
The goal is to combine consistent information, identify conflicting information, and filter out irrelevant information. This step helps in resolving knowledge 
conflicts between the LLM's internal knowledge and the retrieved knowledge from external sources.

3. **Answer Proposal and Selection**: Finally, Astute RAG proposes answers based on each group of consistent passages and compares the answers from different passage groups to determine the final answer. This step ensures that only trustworthy information is used for answering, thereby improving the reliability of RAG.

Astute RAG has been shown to consistently outperform baselines across different retrieval quality levels and LLMs. Notably, it is the only RAG method that achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing conventional use of LLMs under the worst-case scenario where all retrieved passages are unhelpful.

8. Explain Adaptive Generation of Internal Knowledge

Answer: Adaptive Generation of Internal Knowledge is a method where a large language model (LLM) generates passages based on a given question, using its own pre-existing knowledge. This method is used to supplement any missing information from a limited set of retrieved passages and to enable mutual confirmation between the LLM's internal and external knowledge. The LLM is guided by constitutional principles in the prompt, emphasizing the generation of accurate, relevant, 
and hallucination-free passages. The LLM decides how many passages to generate, up to a maximum limit, and indicates if no more reliable information is available. This approach allows the LLM to generate fewer or more passages based on the amount of useful information within its internal knowledge.

9. What is source awareness?

Answer: Source awareness refers to the ability of a system to identify and keep track of the origin or source of information. In the context provided, source awareness is used in the iterative source-aware knowledge consolidation step of Astute RAG, where generated and retrieved passages are compared to consolidate internal and external knowledge. By being source-aware, the system can better differentiate between the reliability of the LLM‚Äôs intrinsic knowledge and the external information retrieved in RAG, utilizing each only when trustworthy and ensuring proper integration.

10. Explain passage source.

Answer: A passage source indicates the original location or origin of the information presented in a passage. It can help assess the reliability and credibility of the information by providing context about its source. In the given context, the passage source is denoted as S0=[1{d‚ààE}for d in D0].subscriptùëÜ0delimited 
-\[\]subscript1ùëëùê∏forùëëinsubscriptùê∑0S\_{0}=\[\\mathbbm{1}\_{\\{d\\in E\\}}\\text{for}\\ d\\ \\text    {in}\\ D\_{0}\].italic\_S start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT = \[ blackboard\_1 start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT { italic\_d ‚àà italic\_E } end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT for italic\_d in italic\_D start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT \]. This source information is used to consolidate knowledge, identify consistent information, detect conflicting information, filter out irrelevant information, and regroup unreliable knowledge into refined passages.

11. Explain answer finalization

Answer: Answer finalization is the process of selecting the most accurate and well-supported answer from a group of documents after consolidating information from both memorized documents and externally retrieved documents. This step involves proposing possible answers for each group of documents and assigning a confidence score based on the credibility and agreement of the information. The final answer is then selected from the proposed answers, highlighting the exact answer within the chosen response.

12. How do we check the effectiveness of Astute Rag.

Answer: To check the effectiveness of Astute RAG, you can compare its performance with baselines across different subsets partitioned by their retrieval precision. Astute RAG achieves consistently better performance than all baselines across different retrieval precision, indicating its effectiveness in improving RAG trustworthiness in broad scenarios. Notably, Astute RAG does not sacrifice performance gain under high retrieval quality in exchange for improvement under low retrieval quality. When the retrieval quality is extremely low, all other RAG variants underperform the 'No RAG' baseline, except for the proposed Astute RAG. This demonstrates the difficulty in overcoming imperfect retrieval augmentation and verifies the effectiveness of Astute RAG in doing so. Additionally, you can evaluate its performance in addressing knowledge conflicts. On the conflicting subset, Astute RAG successfully chooses the correct answer in approximately 80% of cases, being the most effective method in addressing knowledge conflicts. It even brings performance improvement on the subset where neither internal nor 
external knowledge alone leads to the correct answer, indicating its ability to effectively combine partially-correct information from internal and external knowledge.

13. What is RGB?

Answer: RGB, in the given context, refers to a RAG diagnostic benchmark used for evaluating several crucial RAG abilities. It is specifically chosen for evaluating noise robustness in the context of retrieval augmented generation. The benchmark consists of positive and negative passage sets for each question, and a model response is considered correct if it contains the ground-truth answer.

14. What is generation temperature?

Answer: The generation temperature is a hyperparameter in language models that controls the randomness of the predictions. A higher temperature value results in more random outputs, while a lower value makes the model's predictions more deterministic and focused on the most likely output.

15. What is RobustRag?     

Answer: RobustRAG is a method that aggregates answers from separate, independent passages to provide a robust response. It is designed to handle scenarios where the majority of retrieved passages may contain negative or unhelpful information, by utilizing the internal knowledge of large language models to recover from failures in the retriever component. This is achieved without requiring any additional training, directly addressing knowledge conflicts to combine helpful information from both internal and external sources, ultimately leading to more reliable answers.

16. How is astute rag used in Gemini and Claude?

Answer: Astute RAG is used in Gemini and Claude by utilizing it in the process of generating answers to questions. It improves the trustworthiness of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model by consistently achieving better performance across different subsets partitioned by their retrieval precision. Additionally, it addresses knowledge conflicts effectively, being the most efficient method in choosing the correct answer in approximately 80% of cases on the conflicting subset. It also combines partially-correct information from internal and external knowledge to achieve the correct answer. The parameter m^^ùëö\\hat{m}over^ start\_ARG italic\_m end\_ARG is set to a smaller value for consistency and efficiency, limiting the influence of internal knowledge. The improvement in performance compared with the best baseline is relatively 6.85% on Claude and 4.13% on Gemini. On Claude, increasing the number of iterations of knowledge consolidation leads to consistent improvement, while on Gemini, it primarily benefits BioASQ and PopQA, which rely more heavily on external knowledge. Performance on NQ and TriviaQA does not improve further when tùë°titalic\_t reaches 3, attributed to the less critical  role of external knowledge in these datasets.

17. Explain General Settings of LLMs and RAG ?

Answer: Large Language Models (LLMs) are pretrained models that can generate human-like text based on the input they receive. They have been widely used in various natural language processing tasks such as text generation, translation, and summarization. However, LLMs can sometimes generate incorrect or incomplete responses due to their limited knowledge or understanding of specific contexts.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines LLMs with an external knowledge source to improve the accuracy and reliability of the generated responses. RAG works by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base or corpus and using it to supplement the input given to the LLM. This allows the LLM to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses by leveraging the external knowledge source.

The general settings of LLMs and RAG involve the following components:

1. LLMs: These are pretrained models that can generate text based on the input they receive. They can be fine-tuned on specific tasks or left unmodified.      
2. Knowledge Base or Corpus: This is the external knowledge source that is used to retrieve relevant information for the LLM. It can be a database, a knowledge graph, or a large text corpus.
3. Retriever: This is the component that retrieves relevant information from the knowledge base or corpus based on the input given to the LLM.
4. Generator: This is the component that generates the text based on the input given to the LLM and the retrieved information from the knowledge base or corpus.
5. Integration: This is the component that combines the generated text with the retrieved information to produce the final response.

The settings of LLMs and RAG can vary depending on the specific task and the knowledge base or corpus used. However, the general idea is to combine the strengths of LLMs and external knowledge sources to generate more accurate and reliable responses.

18. Give the implementation details for Astute Rag

Answer: The context does not provide specific implementation details for Astute RAG. However, it does give an overview of its approach and components. Astute RAG is designed to be resilient to imperfect retrieval augmentation while preserving the grounding effect of RAG when it is reliable. It consists of three main 
steps:

1. **Eliciting information from LLMs‚Äô internal knowledge**: Astute RAG first extracts information from the large language model's (LLM) internal knowledge to complement the passages retrieved from external sources.

2. **Source-aware knowledge consolidation**: Astute RAG then performs source-aware consolidation of information from various internal and external sources. The goal is to combine consistent information, identify conflicting information, and filter out irrelevant information.

3. **Proposing answers**: Finally, Astute RAG generates answers based on each group of consistent passages and compares the answers from different passage groups to determine the final answer.

The context suggests that this method outperforms previous RAG approaches in various experiments involving different datasets and LLMs. However, specific implementation details like the algorithms, functions, or code structure used to build Astute RAG are not provided in the context.

19. What are the issues with RAG? How does Astute RAG fix them?

Answer: RAG, or Retrieval Augmented Generation, faces challenges due to the inherent limitation of its knowledge source and the negative impact of noisy information within retrieved passages. These issues can have significant consequences, particularly in risk-sensitive domains.

Astute RAG addresses these problems by effectively combining partially-correct information from LLM-internal and external knowledge. It has been shown to outperform baselines across various datasets, achieving an overall improvement of approximately 6.85% on Claude and 4.13% on Gemini. This effectiveness is particularly noticeable in domain-specific questions.

Astute RAG also demonstrates robustness in worst-case scenarios where all retrieved documents are negative, performing nearly as well as the 'No RAG' method. It effectively identifies errors in its generated passages by confirming with external sources and detects correct answers from noisy retrieved information by checking with its internal knowledge.

Furthermore, Astute RAG improves the trustworthiness of RAG in broad scenarios, not sacrificing performance under high retrieval quality in exchange for improvement under low retrieval quality. It effectively overcomes imperfect retrieval augmentation, even when the retrieval quality is extremely low.

20. Give a conclusion to the article

Answer: The article explores the impact of imperfect retrieval on the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and identifies knowledge conflicts as a key challenge. To address this, the paper introduces Astute RAG, a novel approach that leverages the internal knowledge of Language Models (LLMs) and iteratively refines the generated responses by consolidating internal and external knowledge in a source way. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of Astute RAG in mitigating the negative effects of imperfect retrieval and improving the robustness of RAG systems, particularly in challenging scenarios with unreliable external sources. However, the method's effectiveness hinges on the capabilities of advanced LLMs with strong instruction-following and reasoning abilities, and its applicability may be limited with less sophisticated LLMs. Future work includes extending the experimental setup to longer outputs, analyzing the impact of various context types, and addressing knowledge conflicts beyond LLMs and RAG, such as in multimodal settings.
